Key decisions: (1) GitHub Actions instead of local Python since no local Python install, (2) Intelligent task sorting by content analysis (health/medical highest priority, then financial/communication, then research/setup, then purchases), (3) Cloudflare Pages over GitHub Pages for better global CDN performance. Dashboard auto-updates within 60 seconds of any git push. URL: https://personal-assistant-dashboard.pages.dev/"
