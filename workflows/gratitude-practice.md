# Gratitude Practice Workflow

A simple, structured gratitude practice to run regularly (daily, weekly, or as desired).

## Purpose

- Develop awareness of what's working
- Shift attention to positive patterns
- Build a reviewable record of good things over time

## Process

### Simple Daily Version

Ask three questions:
1. "What's one thing you're grateful for today?"
2. "Who helped or supported you recently?"
3. "What went better than expected?"

Log responses as outcomes tagged with "gratitude" for later review.

### Deeper Weekly Version

Ask:
1. "What brought you joy this week?"
2. "What challenge are you grateful to have faced?"
3. "What relationship or connection mattered?"
4. "What did you learn or realize?"

Log as outcomes with more context.

## Storage

Store gratitude entries as outcomes in `data/outcomes/outcomes.json` with:
- Type: "gratitude"
- Date
- Content
- Optional context

This makes them reviewable during year-end reflection.

## Tone

Keep it grounded. This isn't about forced positivity—it's about noticing what's actually present. If the user is struggling to find things, that's valuable data too. Don't push.

## Frequency

Let the user decide:
- Daily (brief, 2-3 minutes)
- Weekly (deeper, 5-10 minutes)
- Occasional (when they want it)

Don't make this feel like homework.
