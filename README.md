# Personal Assistant System

An external cognitive system and thinking partner built to work with Claude Code.

## Purpose

This system helps:
- Externalize cognition and reduce mental load
- Maintain continuity across time
- Convert experience into insight through structured reflection
- Support better thinking and decision-making

## How to Use

Open Claude Code in this directory and:
- Say "check-in" for daily interaction
- Say "weekly review" for end-of-week reflection
- Say "gratitude" for gratitude practice
- Say "show summary" to see current state

## Structure

- `system-prompt.md` - Instructions for Claude on how to behave
- `workflows/` - Templates for different types of interactions
- `data/` - Your domains, projects, tasks, and outcomes
- `context/` - Current focus and open questions

## Multi-Computer Usage

This repo is designed to sync between multiple computers via Git. Claude Code automatically:
- Pulls latest changes before reading
- Commits and pushes after modifications

Work seamlessly between laptop and desktop without thinking about sync.

## Getting Started

1. Run your first check-in: "check-in"
2. Define your domains when prompted
3. Start capturing what's happening

The system builds value over time as you use it.
