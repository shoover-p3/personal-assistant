# Past Year Review Workflow

A comprehensive annual review using multiple complementary frameworks. Run this annually (typically late December or early January).

## Purpose

- Review what actually happened (not what you wish happened)
- Identify patterns across different lenses (analytical, spiritual, philosophical, holistic)
- Make informed decisions about what to continue, modify, or stop
- Replace resolution theater with honest inventory

## Prerequisites

This works best if you have:
- Logged outcomes throughout the year
- Project history
- Task records
- Gratitude entries

If this is your first year, do the best you can with what you remember.

## How to Use This

You can run **one framework**, **several**, or **all five**. Each offers a different perspective:

1. **Tim Ferriss Past Year Review** - Analytical, Pareto-focused, action-oriented
2. **Ignatian Examen** - Spiritual, reflective, emotion and gratitude-focused
3. **Stoic Annual Review** - Philosophical, virtue-based, control-focused
4. **YearCompass** - Structured workbook, diverse questions, forward and backward
5. **Wheel of Life** - Visual, holistic, domain-based balance assessment

Choose based on what resonates or run all for a comprehensive view.

## Framework 1: Tim Ferriss Past Year Review

**Best for:** Data-driven people who want to optimize time and energy allocation.

**Time:** 2-3 hours

### Part 1: Positive Inventory

Review the past year month by month and ask:

**For each month (Jan - Dec):**
1. "What activities, people, or experiences made you feel energized or fulfilled?"
2. "What went unexpectedly well?"
3. "What are you proud of?"

List 3-5 items per month. Be specific.

### Part 2: Negative Inventory

Review the past year month by month and ask:

**For each month (Jan - Dec):**
1. "What activities, people, or situations drained your energy?"
2. "What did you dread?"
3. "What felt like a waste of time?"

List 3-5 items per month. Be honest.

### Part 3: Pattern Analysis

Look across all 12 months:

1. **Positive patterns** - What shows up repeatedly in the positive list?
2. **Negative patterns** - What shows up repeatedly in the negative list?
3. **Pareto principle** - Which 20% of activities produced 80% of positive outcomes?
4. **Time sinks** - What consumed time without creating value?

### Part 4: Decisions (Continue / Modify / Stop)

Based on the patterns:

**Continue:**
- What should you do more of?
- What deserves more time and attention?

**Modify:**
- What has potential but needs adjustment?
- What constraints or changes would make something work better?

**Stop:**
- What should you cut entirely?
- What's not worth fixing?

### Part 5: Not-To-Do List

Create a concrete "not-to-do" list based on negative patterns:
- Specific activities to avoid
- Specific people or situations to limit
- Specific commitments not to make

This is more actionable than resolutions.

## Framework 2: Ignatian Examen (Annual Version)

**Best for:** Those seeking spiritual insight, emotional awareness, and gratitude-focused reflection.

**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Background:** The Examen is a technique of prayerful reflection from Ignatian spirituality, adapted here for annual review. Focus on noticing God's presence (or deeper meaning) in the events of your year.

### Preparation

Begin with a pause. Take slow, deep breaths. Become aware that you are in the presence of something greater than yourself—God, the universe, deeper wisdom.

Ask for grace to see your life not through your own limited perspective, but with wisdom and clarity.

### Part 1: Gratitude

Review the past year and ask:
1. "What am I most grateful for from this year?"
2. "Where did I experience unexpected grace, help, or support?"
3. "What gifts—large and small—did I receive?"

List at least 10 items. Let gratitude emerge naturally.

### Part 2: Emotional Review

Go through the year month by month or by major events:
1. "What moments brought consolation (peace, joy, energy, love)?"
2. "What moments brought desolation (anxiety, sadness, disconnection, exhaustion)?"
3. "Where did I feel most alive? Most empty?"

Notice patterns in what creates consolation vs desolation.

### Part 3: Presence and Absence

Reflect on:
1. "Where was I fully present this year?"
2. "Where was I absent, distracted, or going through the motions?"
3. "Where did I experience God/deeper meaning/connection?"
4. "Where did I feel distant or disconnected?"

### Part 4: Forgiveness and Healing

Ask:
1. "What do I need to forgive myself for?"
2. "Who do I need to forgive?"
3. "What wounds from this year need healing?"
4. "What regrets do I need to release?"

### Part 5: Forward Movement

Based on this reflection:
1. "What is God/life/wisdom inviting me toward in the coming year?"
2. "What needs to change for me to live more fully?"
3. "What one word or intention captures what I'm being called to?"

## Framework 3: Stoic Annual Review

**Best for:** Those interested in philosophical reflection, virtue, character development, and what's within your control.

**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Background:** Inspired by Marcus Aurelius's Meditations and Stoic practices of self-examination.

### Part 1: Virtue Assessment

Review the year through the lens of the four cardinal virtues:

**Wisdom:**
- When did I demonstrate good judgment?
- When did I act foolishly or impulsively?
- What did I learn?

**Justice:**
- When did I treat others fairly and with integrity?
- When did I fail to act justly?
- Where did I contribute to the common good?

**Courage:**
- When did I face fear or difficulty well?
- When did I avoid what needed to be done?
- Where did I show moral courage?

**Temperance (Self-Control):**
- When did I exercise discipline and moderation?
- When did I indulge excessively or lose control?
- Where did I demonstrate restraint?

### Part 2: What Was In Your Control

Reflect honestly:
1. "What did I control this year?" (Your thoughts, actions, responses, effort)
2. "What did I not control?" (Others' actions, outcomes, external events)
3. "Where did I waste energy trying to control the uncontrollable?"
4. "Where did I fail to take responsibility for what I could control?"

### Part 3: Character Development

Ask:
1. "What kind of person did I become this year?"
2. "What habits of character did I develop (good and bad)?"
3. "How did I respond to adversity?"
4. "Did I become more or less aligned with who I want to be?"

### Part 4: Memento Mori (Remember Death)

Reflect soberly:
1. "If this had been my last year, would I be satisfied with how I lived it?"
2. "What would I regret not having done?"
3. "What truly mattered vs what I treated as if it mattered?"
4. "How do I want to be remembered?"

### Part 5: Philosophical Resolutions

Based on this review:
1. "What virtue will I prioritize developing?"
2. "What is within my control that I will commit to?"
3. "What Stoic principle will guide me?" (e.g., amor fati, premeditatio malorum, the view from above)

## Framework 4: YearCompass

**Best for:** Those who want a structured, comprehensive workbook with diverse prompts covering both reflection and planning.

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Background:** YearCompass is a free annual review workbook used by over 1 million people worldwide. It balances backward reflection with forward planning.

### Part 1: Reviewing the Past Year

**Major Milestones:**
- List the year's most significant events and experiences

2. "Three people who impacted my life most"
3. "Three unexpected lessons I learned"
4. "Three things I want to leave behind"

**Success and Failure:**
- What did you accomplish that you're proud of?
- What failures or setbacks did you experience?
- What did you learn from both?

**This Year's Word:**
- If you had to describe this year in one word, what would it be?

### Part 2: Assessing Different Life Areas

2. **Relationships** - Who enriched your life? Who drained it?
3. **Health** - How did you care for your body and mind?
4. **Personal Growth** - How did you develop?

3. "Three things I want to achieve most"
4. "Three people who will be my pillars"
5. "Three things I will dare to discover"
6. "Three things I will say no to"

**Magic Question:**
- If you had unlimited resources and couldn't fail, what would you do next year?

## Framework 5: Wheel of Life Assessment

**Best for:** Visual thinkers who want a holistic view of life balance across domains.

**Time:** 30-60 minutes

**Background:** Created by Paul J. Meyer in the 1960s, this tool provides a visual snapshot of satisfaction across life areas.

### Part 1: Define Your Life Areas

Common categories (adjust to fit your life):
1. Career/Work
2. Finances
3. Health & Fitness
4. Family & Friends
5. Romance/Partnership
6. Personal Growth
7. Fun & Recreation
8. Physical Environment

### Part 2: Score Each Area

For each life area, rate your current satisfaction:
- **1** = Extremely dissatisfied
- **10** = Fully satisfied, thriving

Be honest. This is a snapshot of how things actually are, not how you wish they were.

### Part 3: Visualize the Wheel

On paper or digitally, create a wheel with 8 spokes (one per life area).
Mark your score on each spoke from center (1) to edge (10).
Connect the dots.

**What does your wheel look like?**
- Is it round (balanced)?
- Is it bumpy or uneven?
- Which areas are thriving?
- Which need attention?

### Part 4: Reflect

Ask:
1. "Which low-scoring areas matter most to me right now?"
2. "Why did I score each area the way I did?"
3. "What would it take to increase each score by 1-2 points?"
4. "Am I okay with the current balance, or does something need to shift?"

### Part 5: Prioritize

Choose 1-3 areas to focus on improving in the coming year.
For each:
- What specific actions would move the score up?
- What's preventing it from being higher now?
- What's a realistic target score for next year?

---

## General Guidelines

**Tone:**
Be ruthlessly honest across all frameworks. These only work if you acknowledge reality as it is. The goal is not to feel good—it's to gain clarity and make better decisions.

**Timeline:**
- **One framework:** 1-3 hours depending on which one
- **All five frameworks:** Spread across multiple days (5-8 hours total)

**Output:**
Log all insights, patterns, and decisions as outcomes in `data/outcomes/outcomes.json` for future reference and comparison next year.

**When to Run:**
Late December through early January is traditional, but run it whenever the year feels complete for you.
