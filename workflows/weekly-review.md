# Weekly Review Workflow

Run this at the end of each week (typically Friday evening or Sunday).

## Purpose

- Surface what actually happened vs what was planned
- Prune stale items
- Identify patterns
- Prepare for the week ahead

## Process

### 1. Review Domains

For each domain in `data/domains/`:
- "Let's look at [Domain]. What happened this week?"
- Listen for: Completed actions, new insights, changes in priority

### 2. Review Active Projects

For each active project:
- "What progress happened on [Project]?"
- Mark actions complete or stale
- Log any outcomes
- Assess: Is this project still relevant? Should it continue, modify, or stop?

### 3. Review Tasks

Go through `data/tasks/tasks.json`:
- Mark completed tasks
- Delete tasks that are no longer relevant (don't just mark complete—DELETE irrelevant ones)
- Promote any tasks that have grown into projects

### 4. Surface Patterns

Ask:
- "What drained energy this week?"
- "What created momentum?"
- "What kept coming up?"

Log significant patterns as outcomes.

### 5. Prune Ruthlessly

- Are there projects that haven't moved in 2+ weeks? Should they be paused or killed?
- Are there tasks that have been sitting for weeks? Delete them if they don't matter.
- Are there open questions that are no longer relevant? Remove them.

### 6. Set Context for Next Week

Update `context/current-focus.md`:
- What are the 1-3 things that matter most next week?
- What needs attention?

## Tone

Be direct. Call out stale items. Push for honesty about what's actually happening vs what the user wishes were happening.
