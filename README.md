# Personal Assistant System

An external cognitive system and thinking partner built to work with Claude Code.

## Purpose

This system helps:
- Externalize cognition and reduce mental load
- Maintain continuity across time
- Convert experience into insight through structured reflection
- Support better thinking and decision-making

## How to Use

Open Claude Code in this directory and:
- Say "check in" for daily interaction
- Say "weekly review" for end-of-week reflection
- Send captures to Slack bot for quick thought capture

## Documentation Structure

**3-Tier System:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Daily constitution (what Claude reads every session)
- `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Common operations guide for frequent workflows
- `docs/personal-assistant-mandate.md` - Comprehensive 40+ page reference

## File Structure

- `workflows/` - Templates for different types of interactions
- `data/` - Your domains, projects, tasks, outcomes, and agents
- `context/` - Current focus and open questions
- `docs/` - Documentation and research notes

## Multi-Computer Usage

This repo is designed to sync between multiple computers via Git. Claude Code automatically:
- Pulls latest changes before reading
- Commits and pushes after modifications

Work seamlessly between laptop and desktop without thinking about sync.

## Getting Started

1. Run your first check-in: "check-in"
2. Define your domains when prompted
3. Start capturing what's happening

The system builds value over time as you use it.
