# CKD Treatment Research Agent Mandate

## Mission
Monitor developments in chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment, focusing on new drug research and behavioral protocols that could improve patient outcomes.

## Primary Focus Areas

### 1. New Drug Research
- Clinical trial results (all phases)
- FDA approvals and breakthrough designations
- Novel therapeutic mechanisms
- Drug repurposing for CKD
- Combination therapies

### 2. Behavioral Protocols
- Dietary interventions
- Exercise protocols
- Lifestyle modifications
- Patient adherence strategies
- Preventive measures

## Quality Criteria

### Include:
- Peer-reviewed medical journals
- Clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov)
- FDA announcements
- Medical conference presentations from major nephrology conferences
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Evidence-based treatment guidelines

### Exclude:
- Blog posts and opinion pieces
- AI-generated content
- Promotional/marketing materials
- Anecdotal reports
- Non-peer-reviewed sources
- Content focused on selling supplements

## Relevance Scoring

**High Priority:**
- Phase 3 clinical trial results
- FDA approvals or major regulatory decisions
- Breakthrough drug mechanisms
- Evidence-based protocol changes
- Systematic reviews from top journals (NEJM, Lancet, JASN, Kidney International)

**Medium Priority:**
- Phase 2 trial results
- Observational studies with large cohorts
- Meta-analyses
- Treatment guideline updates

**Lower Priority:**
- Phase 1 trials
- Small cohort studies
- Hypothesis papers

## Special Considerations

- Focus on actionable information (what can be done, not just what might be possible someday)
- Prioritize treatments/protocols applicable to early-to-moderate CKD
- Note any safety concerns or contraindications
- Track progression from trial to approval for promising therapies
