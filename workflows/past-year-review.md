# Past Year Review Workflow

Based on Tim Ferriss's "Past Year Review" framework. Run this annually (typically late December or early January).

## Purpose

- Review what actually happened (not what you wish happened)
- Identify patterns in what created energy vs drained it
- Make informed decisions about what to continue, modify, or stop
- Replace resolution theater with honest inventory

## Prerequisites

This works best if you have:
- Logged outcomes throughout the year
- Project history
- Task records
- Gratitude entries

If this is your first year, do the best you can with what you remember.

## The Process

### Part 1: Positive Inventory

Review the past year month by month and ask:

**For each month (Jan - Dec):**
1. "What activities, people, or experiences made you feel energized or fulfilled?"
2. "What went unexpectedly well?"
3. "What are you proud of?"

List 3-5 items per month. Be specific.

### Part 2: Negative Inventory

Review the past year month by month and ask:

**For each month (Jan - Dec):**
1. "What activities, people, or situations drained your energy?"
2. "What did you dread?"
3. "What felt like a waste of time?"

List 3-5 items per month. Be honest.

### Part 3: Pattern Analysis

Look across all 12 months:

1. **Positive patterns** - What shows up repeatedly in the positive list?
2. **Negative patterns** - What shows up repeatedly in the negative list?
3. **Pareto principle** - Which 20% of activities produced 80% of positive outcomes?
4. **Time sinks** - What consumed time without creating value?

### Part 4: Decisions (Continue / Modify / Stop)

Based on the patterns:

**Continue:**
- What should you do more of?
- What deserves more time and attention?

**Modify:**
- What has potential but needs adjustment?
- What constraints or changes would make something work better?

**Stop:**
- What should you cut entirely?
- What's not worth fixing?

### Part 5: Not-To-Do List

Create a concrete "not-to-do" list based on negative patterns:
- Specific activities to avoid
- Specific people or situations to limit
- Specific commitments not to make

This is more actionable than resolutions.

## Output

Generate a summary document:
- Key positive patterns
- Key negative patterns
- Continue / Modify / Stop decisions
- Not-to-do list

Store this as an outcome for future reference.

## Tone

Be ruthlessly honest. This only works if you acknowledge reality as it is. The goal is not to feel good—it's to make better decisions going forward.

## Timeline

This takes 2-3 hours. Don't rush it. Consider spreading it across multiple sessions if needed.
