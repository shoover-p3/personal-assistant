## Slack Bot Setup

**Issue:** Can't send DMs to bot - "Sending messages to this app has been turned off"

**Tried:** Reinstalled app 3+ times, verified all scopes, checked manifest, updated tokens multiple times

**Next Step:** Create brand new Slack app from scratch (Option 2 from SETUP-STATUS.md). Discuss after next check-in.

## Flow Trade System - Research Process

**Challenge:** So many levers to pull on this project - having trouble figuring out where to start and how to confirm that research being done is reliable and accurate.

**Core Question:** What's the right process from idea generation to thoroughly vetted tradable strategy?

**Specific Problem:** Can't trust that backtests are being done correctly. This is where it's falling down.

**Considerations:**
- Need systematic approach to evaluate which levers to pull first
- Need validation framework to ensure research is reliable
- Need backtest verification methodology - how to know if the backtest implementation is correct?
- Project is highest-importance but complexity is causing paralysis
